#🌱 Sowing Success: Machine Learning Helps Farmers Select the Best Crops

##🚜 Overview
Agriculture meets algorithms. This project explores how Machine Learning (ML) is transforming farming by helping farmers make smarter decisions about crop selection based on soil data, climate, and other environmental factors.

Using a combination of data preprocessing, classification models, and visual analytics, this project demonstrates how modern tools can lead to better yields, resource efficiency, and informed decisions.

##🧠 How It Works
We analyze several parameters that influence crop yield:

- 🌡️ Temperature

- 💧 Humidity

- 🌧️ Rainfall

- 🧪 Soil pH

- 🌾 Nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)

##🔍 Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest

- Decision Tree

- Naive Bayes

- K-Nearest Neighbors

- Logistic Regression

- Each model is trained and evaluated to determine the best performer in predicting the most suitable crop.
