# 🌾 Crop Recommendation using Machine Learning

This repository contains a **Python-based machine learning project** that assists farmers in selecting the most suitable crops based on environmental conditions such as soil quality and climate. By analyzing key parameters and using multiple ML models, the system provides data-driven crop recommendations to help improve yield and sustainability.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that recommends optimal crops by analyzing:

- Temperature and humidity conditions  
- Rainfall and soil pH levels  
- Nutrient concentrations (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)  

The goal is to support **smart farming** decisions and reduce the risks of poor yield due to unsuitable crop choices.

## 🧪 Methodology

### Part 1: Data Preparation

- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Normalize and encode features  
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Feature scaling if required  

### Part 2: Model Training & Evaluation

Classification models used:

- 🌳 Random Forest  
- 🌲 Decision Tree  
- 🧮 Naive Bayes  
- 📍 K-Nearest Neighbors  
- 📉 Logistic Regression  

Each model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### Part 3: Crop Recommendation

- Input real-time climate and soil data  
- Predict the most suitable crop  
- Export results for external use (CSV, Excel, etc.)
